# .clinerules

This document lists the guidelines that Cline must follow when performing AI-assisted coding.

## Implementation Guidelines

- Keep the design information documented in the `/docs` directory in mind.
  - If there is a need for an update, propose the necessary changes.
- Integrate tests alongside the implementation.
  - For testing, only test code is required
  - Unless otherwise instructed, there is no need to check the behavior of the process in a browser or with curl.

## Interacting with AI Assistant

- Use English to get the answers you seek while saving tokens

## Rules Update

- If you encounter recurring patterns or implementation practices during command processing, propose updates to either the `.clinerules` file or `/docs/coding_rule.md` file.
