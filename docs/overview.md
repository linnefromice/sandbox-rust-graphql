# API Server Implementation Documentation

This document provides an overview of the API server architecture, detailing the use of **async-graphql** for GraphQL schema and resolvers, **axum** as the web framework, and **diesel** as the ORM for database interactions. It outlines the design decisions, setup instructions, and integration points for these technologies.

## Introduction

This project is designed to build a robust, type-safe GraphQL API server in Rust. By leveraging the strengths of **async-graphql**, **axum**, and **diesel**, we ensure that the application is not only performant but also maintains a clean separation of concerns.

## Technology Stack

### async-graphql

- **Purpose:** Provides an easy-to-use, type-safe GraphQL framework for defining schemas and resolvers.
- **Key Features:**
  - Asynchronous resolver support.
  - Automatic schema generation and introspection.
  - Middleware support for authentication and logging.
- **Documentation:** [async-graphql Docs](https://async-graphql.github.io/)

### axum

- **Purpose:** Acts as the web framework that handles HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate handlers.
- **Key Features:**
  - Integration with Tokio for asynchronous processing.
  - Easy to set up route handlers and middleware.
  - Seamless integration with async-graphql through dedicated connectors.
- **Documentation:** [axum Docs](https://docs.rs/axum/)

### diesel

- **Purpose:** Serves as the ORM layer for database interactions, ensuring type-safe queries and migrations.
- **Key Features:**
  - Compile-time checked queries.
  - Support for various SQL databases.
  - Integration with connection pooling libraries.
- **Documentation:** [diesel Docs](https://diesel.rs/)

## Architecture Overview

The server follows a layered architecture:

- **API Layer:**  
  Managed by axum, this layer handles HTTP requests, including routing and middleware integration.

- **GraphQL Layer:**  
  Built with async-graphql, this layer defines the schema and implements resolvers that handle the business logic.

- **Data Access Layer:**  
  diesel is used here to interact with the underlying SQL database, ensuring data integrity and type-safe queries.

This separation of concerns facilitates easier testing, maintenance, and scalability.
